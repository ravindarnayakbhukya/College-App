# College-App
College App Project

This is a College website application. I have created this using Python Django framework. Users must have to login with valid credentials so that they can access their own data. Users are prohibited from accessing others data.

Here is the screenshot of the website: https://github.com/ravindarnayakbhukya/College-App/blob/main/2022-11-24.png

To open the website, we must run server in Command Prompt and login  with valid credentials. So as of now, we can preview the html and css codes at https://github.com/ravindarnayakbhukya/College-App/blob/main/index.html and https://github.com/ravindarnayakbhukya/College-App/blob/main/static/stylesheets/index.css.
