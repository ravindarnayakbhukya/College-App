# College-App
Here is the screenshot of the website: https://github.com/ravindarnayakbhukya/College-App/blob/main/MANIT.png

This is a College website application. This website consists of Admissions and Finance details of  Students of an Educational Institution. I have created this using Python Django framework. Users must have to login with valid credentials so that they can access their own data. User-Admin can give the permissions to users for accessing others data.

Key skills/expertise involved: Django, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Database, Web API, Admin UI, Authentication, Authorization
                                        
use `python manage.py runserver` command to run server and login  with valid credentials.
