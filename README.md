# College-App
College App Project

https://ravindarnayakbhukya.github.io/College-App/ 
This is a College website application. I have created this using Python Django framework. 

To open the website, we must run server in Django and login  with valid credentials. So as of now, we can preview the html and css codes at https://github.com/ravindarnayakbhukya/College-App/blob/main/index.html and https://github.com/ravindarnayakbhukya/College-App/blob/main/index.css.
