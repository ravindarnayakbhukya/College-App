# College-App
Here is the screenshot of the website: https://github.com/ravindarnayakbhukya/College-App/blob/main/MANIT.png

This is a College website application. I have created this using Python Django framework. Users must have to login with valid credentials so that they can access their own data. User-Admin can give the permissions to users for accessing others data.

Key skills/expertise involved: Django, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Database, Web API, Admin UI, Authentication, Authorization

To open the website, we must run server in Command Prompt and login  with valid credentials. So as of now, we can preview the
